# Radiohead Audio Feature Analysis

## Overview
This project explores the audio features of Radiohead's discography using data obtained from Spotify’s API. By analyzing key metrics such as energy, valence (emotional positivity), and loudness, we aim to gain insights into the evolution of Radiohead's sound across their albums. Various visualizations are presented to highlight trends in energy over time, as well as the relationships between energy and other audio features.
